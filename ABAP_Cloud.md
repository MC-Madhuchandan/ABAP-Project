ABAP ON CLOUD

1.	Iaas – Infrastructure as a service          
•	Here we rent out Hardware systems from outsource vendor and we can consume hardware based on rent

2.	Paas- Platform as a service 
•	Here we rent out Hardware and software and start to build our own application
ex: SAP ABAP, SAP BTP, Eclipse

3.	Saas- Software as a service 
•	Here we consume the software which is ready to use (customers)
Ex: swiggy, Netflix etc.

Cloud foundry : its an open source Paas which was built by a company called Pivotal Software (a joint venture by EMC, Robert Bosch & sun microsystem)

Sap built a platform called BTP (Paas)
sap took libraries images and added their own features to build BTP software 

ADVANTAGES OF BTP

1.	SCALABILITY
2.	ELASTICITY (swap from one cloud to another)
3.	LOW TCO (total cost of ownership)
  A.	Initial investment can be saved by licence cost and all

ENVIRONMENT:

It offers three environments in BTP

1. ABAP environment
2. Cloud Foundry environment
3. Kyma
